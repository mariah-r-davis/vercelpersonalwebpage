Lookup all of the element names such as section, article, header, header 2, main, etc..

What is the benefit of correctly-structured HTML? Semantic HTML is more SEO-friendly, more user-friendly, and more accessible to folks who use page readers or have vision problems for instance

Head vs header in HTML


Class is specifically used for CSS 


Banner// header

Menu// nav


Bold vs Strong:

You can just bold ()aesthetic) but if you are trying to add voice and tone to the copy, use the STRONG tag

Blockquote and address have webpage breaks built into the HTML

Or ust a break element: <br>

<abbr> </abbr> - Abbreviation - you might want to put in ()

<dfn> </dfr> - Definition – “The Beatles were a famous rock group from the 1960’s…”

Quotation marks: <q> </q> vs “”? Best for accessibility 

Citation element: <cite> </cite>

<a> </a> “Anchor” – this is required for a Link element 


<a href= “https://google.com”> We put this in here. </a>

Link: https://google.com
“We put this in here” :  The text that is shown on the URL if you want to put the text on the url

Target = “_self” <- Better understand this part of URLs
